A Quick app I knocked together for the badasshackers to share route data and best distance but also to try out and share arbitrary datasets to run their competition scripts against.

Very rough. Sub optimal in a 10^6 + 1 places and redundant crap littered all over.

Uses spherical law of cosines for approximate distance calculations.
